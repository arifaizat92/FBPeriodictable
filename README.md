Aizat three.js Project
========
This is an assignment project for interview.

It is a three.js project where I need to create a css3d periodic table animation. The project was based on the examples from the main three.js [site](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=perio#css3d_periodictable).

I clone the code from three.js [github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master)
